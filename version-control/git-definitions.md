# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control allows multiple people work on the same project.
  Version control is useful because could separate the workload
  on a project, and it involves a system where all of the code that
  is written is checked out by other memebers of the team or by 
  an instructer. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is a copy of a file and it is necessary to use one
  because it allows you to make changes to the file without
  disrupting the primary file. Once your changes are reviewed by 
  someone else then your changes can be merged with the primary
  file. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is the changes that you make to a file. The commit 
  message is a brief discription to the changes that you made.
* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict is a problem that occurs when you are trying 
  add your changes to the master file. The most common merge 
  conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of 
  the same file. cool!
