Algorithm for a robot using an elevator.
	The elevator covers 20 floors with 5 floors on each row of the control panal.
	The robot has to be programmed to figure out which floor to press.

	#Assuming the robot is positioned right infront of the control panal
	of the elevator. Then the robot should commit the following algorithm:
		-If the floor number is between 1-5 
			-Arm stays level
				- If floor number is 1 then press
				- If it is greater than 1 
					-take floor number and multiply it by 2 inches. FN*2=inches
					- move arm to the right that many inches and press.

		-If the floor number is between 6-10
			- Arm moves up 4 inches 
			- If floor number is 6 then press
			- If floor number is greater than 6 
				-Take floor number subtract it by 5, then multiply it by 2 inches. (FN-5)*2=inches
				-move arm to the right that many inches and press

		-If the floor number is between 11-15
			-Arm moves up 8 inches
			-If floor number is 11 then press
			-If floor number is greater than 11
				-Take floor number and subtract it by 10, then multiply it by 2 inches. (FN-10)*=inches
				-move arm to the right that many inches and press

		-if the floor number is between 15-20
			-Arm moves up 12 inches
			- If the floor number is 15 then press
			-If the floor number is greater than 15 
				-Take floor number and subtract it by 15, then multiply it by 2 inches. (FN-15)*2=inches
				-move arm to the right that many inches and press.

*/ Walking up steps algorithm
	-Start at the base of the steps
	- Until you reach the top of the steps
		-Lift right leg up
		-Follow by lifting left leg up.
		-Repeat
/*

*/ Making my bed algorithm
	- Pick up Blanket
	- Move hands until both of them are holding one of the two shorter ends of the blanket.
		-Move left hand towards the left until it is positioned at the left end of that side.
		-Move right hand towards the right until it is positioned at the right end of that side.
			
			-Place the right end of the blanket on the shorter side of the bed/furtherest side from where you are posiitoned. 
				- Move blanket corner to the right until it is over the right end of the bed
			-Place the left end of the blanket on the shorter side of the bed/furtherest side from where you are positioned.
				-Move blanket corner to the left until it is over the left end of the bed.

		-Place hands at the bottom of the blanket and pull the blanket down until it is flat.
