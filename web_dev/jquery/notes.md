# JQuery Notes

	* It is a javascript library that simplifies javascrip programming.

	* Syntax:
		* $(selector).action()
		* $ = allows accress to jQuery
		* (selector) finds HTML elements
		* .action() is what is preformed on those elements

	* Examples:
		* $('h1').hide() = hides the h1 element
		* $('#anything').hide() = hides the element with the 	id='anything'

	* Events:
		* Represents a percise moment when something should happen. 

	* Examples:
		* $("p").click(function(){
			// action goes here
			});
		* The event is .click
	
	* jQuery helps html pages become more interaction with animation, visuals fading, and sliding throughout the page.

	* What help me the most was looking at examples online of how jQuery is used in html to manuplate the css of the page.

	* Only problem is that I don't know the best way to download the jQuery library on my terminal.

	* For now, I am just going to use the CDN link for google to link jQuery to my html. 
		* <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
